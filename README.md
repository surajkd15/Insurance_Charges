# Insurance_Charges

In this dataset,I predicted the insurance charges of a person. There are some dependent features like age of the person, sex of person, whether the person is a smoker or not, the region from where the person belongs to etc. This is a regression problem. I have used different regression techniques Linear Regression, Decision Tree and tried to predict the charges.
